# ABOUT ME
My name is Joshua Micheal Goodman. I grew up in Baltimore, Maryland. I was born on December 11, 1987. I had many experiences hiking as a child. One of the main locations I experienced was in the Appalacian Trails. My brother and I would go with our Uncle, who at the time was an maintainer of a portion of the trail. Hiking was always a great experience becasue we would see different faces of nature that was not common where we lived. As I got older, hiking was always something I enjoyed and will always be an interest of mine. this website will be for everyone to share their hiking experiences in Iwakuni so that others can visit the many locations that are available.
